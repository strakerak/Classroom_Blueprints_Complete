This is the page to download all build files for the Classroom Blueprints Builder and Viewer. This program was created in 2023 for the University of Houston, with small incremental updates across 2024 and 2025. 

Instructions:
1) Click the green "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP"
2) Extract the files to an area of choice. You are free to delete "gitattributes" and "gitignore". The presence of these files will not break the program.
3) The "WINDOWS" or "APPLE" folders contain the build file for the BUILDER. Open the program and build your classroom. Once you save, you can find the file in the "SaveFiles" folder.
4) Transfer any saves you wish to open to the SaveFiles folder in the "VIEWER WINDOWS ONLY" one.
5) To view it in VR, open the program in the viewer folder while your headset of choice is plugged in. Clicking the "Load" icon, and typing the name of your file.
6) Closing the programs are done via Alt-F4

Notes:

- Do not add any extensions to the save file, simply type in a name of choice. If you add a "." and anything afterwards, remove it by renaming the files in the SaveFiles folder.
- You are able to save and preview builds/files, but are not able to edit them. You are able to overwrite the files with a new save.
- Sometimes the clock floats off the wall after a save


Controls:
- WASD/Arrow Keys for movement
- Q/E for rotation
- Hold control in build mode to delete an object.
- Mouse wheel/gestures to zoom in/out.
